# Wellness-Harvest-Hub Description:

  In this app, I have tried creating an app named as 'Wellness Harvest Hub' using Flutter. In this I have tried on focusing on   developing an mobile application which deals with and solves real life problem of Agriculture, Health and Food areas.
  In this app, you can check your BMI in HealthTech area. You can also enter the food recipes and get suggested recipes or     
  enter the recipe and get their ingredience in FoodTech.
  In AgriTech, you can see the solutions of a given problem by typing the plant part in the TextField.

1. Primary goals of this app are to:
  a) In Health Page, you can check your BMI by entering some necessary details.
  b) In Agriculture Page, you can enter the specific plant part you need help with, and our app will recommend relevant videos      to assist you.
  c) In Food Page, you can enter the type of food you want to eat and a list of related food will appear in the drop-down menu.
2. Features:
  a) Navigate between mutiple pages using elevated button
  b)
